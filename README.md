# **Wireshark Packet Capture & Analysis**
## **Overview**
This project focuses on capturing and analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark**, a powerful network protocol analyzer. The objective is to identify different types of network traffic and understand fundamental protocols.

## **Objective**
- Capture live network packets
- Identify basic protocols and traffic types
- Save the captured packets for analysis



## **Steps to Perform**
1. **Install Wireshark** – Download & set up the tool.
2. **Start Capturing** – Select the active network interface and begin capture.
3. **Generate Traffic** – Visit a website or run `ping google.com` to create network activity.
4. **Stop Capture** – After approximately 1 minute.
5. **Filter Packets** – Apply filters like `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to refine results.
6. **Identify Protocols** – Analyze packets to understand different network protocols.
7. **Save Capture File** – Export data as a `.pcap` file for documentation.
8. **Summarize Observations** – Highlight key findings about network communication.

## **Findings & Insights**
- **HTTP:** Identified website requests and responses.
- **DNS:** Observed domain name resolution traffic.
- **TCP:** Examined connection-based data transfers.


## **Usage**
To reproduce this analysis:
1. Install **Wireshark**.
2. Follow the steps outlined above.
3. Analyze captured packets & document findings.
